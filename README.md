## Project Overview
I have been hired by Silver Lining Strategies, 
where our focus is on creating a machine-learning model 
that is specifically designed to determine the authenticity of transactions, 
distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent ones. 
Our primary objective is to boost the security and dependability of transaction processing,
and in doing so, we aim to protect the interests of customers and uphold the stability of their financial health.


## Dataset Description
This is a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing both legitimate and fraudulent transactions from Jan 1, 2019 to Dec 31, 2020.
It covers credit cards of 1000 customers processing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.

Take a look at how imbalanced this dataset is.

In this image, we see a lot of fraudulent purchases were online or at the grocery store.

Model Performance
High Overall Accuracy: 99.72% in identifying transactions.
Fraud Detection: F1 Score of 0.7362, ROC AUC of 0.9723.
Strength: Excellent at identifying legitimate transactions.
Area to Improve: Boosting fraud detection effectiveness.


## Conclusion
Moving forward, our focus will be on refining the model to enhance its fraud detection capabilities. 
This will involve exploring more advanced data processing techniques, fine-tuning the model parameters,
and possibly integrating additional methodologies to improve the balance between accurately detecting fraud and maintaining high overall performance. 
Our goal is to develop a robust system that excels in both detecting fraud and correctly identifying legitimate transactions.



## Recommendations
- Continue to make advances in machine learning to help better detect these fraud patterns 

- Require two-factor authentication for accounts 

- Offer a free fraud awareness program

- Implement 24/7 support to report fraud and resolve security issues
